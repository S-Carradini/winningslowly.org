         There are plenty of podcasts that will tell you how the latest tech gadget or “innovation” will affect the tech landscape tomorrow, but there aren’t that many concerned with the potential impact of that tech in a decade. In a culture obsessed with <em>now</em>, how can we make choices with a view for tomorrow, next year, and beyond?

               Season 5: Structure and Agency
            </a>
         </h4>
         <p>
            A deep dive on the "structure/agency" problem, or: how individuals and systems relate. This one had a quirk to it, though: we recorded the first nine episodes in the fall of 2016, then the last three in the fall of 2017. (Stephen finishing his Ph.D. and moving across the country, and Chris finishing his M. Div. and moving across the country... had consequences.)

               <a href='https://winningslowly.org/5.01/'>5.01: A Ph.D.-Level Math Problem</a> – in which we introduced a set of axes on which to fit the structure
               and agency question.

            <li>
               <a href='https://winningslowly.org/5.05/'>5.05: "Faint Not"</a> – on civil forfeiture and entrenched legal evil.

            <li>
               <a href='https://winningslowly.org/5.11/'>5.11: Fences, Neighbors, Etc.</a> – on vaccinations and the application of force for the common good.

               Season 4: Globalization
            </a>
         </h4>
         <p>
            In our spring 2016 season, we took a long look at globalization: the good, the bad, the ugly. This was also the first time we planned a season start to finish before we kicked it off, and it shows.
         </p>
         <p>
            We talked about everything from international business (<a href='https://winningslowly.org/4.08/'>4.08: A Ghost in Singapore</a>) to <cite>Star Wars</cite> (<a href='https://winningslowly.org/4.03/'>4.03: The Podcast Awakens</a> and <a href='https://winningslowly.org/4.04/'>4.04: But Was It a Good Movie?</a>) and from social media in a populist era ( <a href='https://winningslowly.org/4.10/'>4.10: The Ancient Wisdom of Usenet</a>) to the challenges of global benevolence ( <a href='https://winningslowly.org/4.02/'>4.01: Unambiguously Meh</a>, <a href='https://winningslowly.org/4.02/'>4.02: Helpiness</a>, and <a href='https://winningslowly.org/4.02/'>4.09: We’re Idealist Realists</a>)
         </p>
         <p>
            Along the way, we developed an important distinction between the <em>reasonable</em> and the <em>justifiable</em>: a way to help us bridge the gap with people we disagree with, while still disagreeing with them—sometimes fervently.
         </p>

               Season 3
            </a>
         </h4>
         <p>
            Season 3 was our first attempt at doing a more topical season, with an emphasis on the relationship between advertising, busines interests, and capitalism and human flourishing.
         </p>
         <p>
            We kicked off the season with
            <a href="https://winningslowly.org/3.01/">3.01: The Ad-Driven Web, Part I</a> and <a href="https://winningslowly.org/3.02/">3.02: The Ad-Driven Web, Part II</a> on July 21 and 28, 2015, respectively, and concluded with some lightning round-style episodes in <a href="https://winningslowly.org/3.14/">3.14: Smorgasbord, Part I</a> and <a href="https://winningslowly.org/3.15/">3.15: Smorgasbord, Part II</a> on October 27 and November 3, 2015, respectively. The season also included our first interview: <a href='https://winningslowly.org/3.09/'>3.09: Many Beautiful Things</a>, with Ryan O’Neal of Sleeping at Last.

         <p>
            Season 2 began with <a href="https://winningslowly.org/2.01/">2.01: Take My Money Please!</a> on January 27, 2015 and concluded with <a href="https://winningslowly.org/2.15/">2.15: Metapodcasting</a> on May 12, 2015.
         </p>
         <p>
            Think of this as our “tightening things up now that we know what we’re doing” season and you won’t be far wrong.

            Our first “official” season—the one that was <em>not</em> a “beta”—started on July 15, 2014, with <a href="https://winningslowly.org/1.01/">1.01: Massive Emotional Contagion</a>, and wrapped up with the release of <a href="https://winningslowly.org/1.18/">1.18: Keep On Keepin’ On</a> on November 18, 2014.</p>

            The main hiccup in Season 1? Stephen’s audio. It varies like crazy week to week, for reasons that eluded us. We blame grumpy, grumpy gremlins.

               Season 0: This Is In Beta!

            Our first season: “This is a beta; bear with us!”—in which we spent a few months just figuring out what we were doing, ran from January 28, 2014 until May 20, 2014. Seriously: we had <em>no idea</em> what we were doing; we just knew we had a good idea for a show and wanted to figure out how to make it work. There is good content here, but we have kept this around mostly for historical interest—it’s <em>rough</em>.

            Episodes ranged in length from over 45 minutes to under 20 minutes as we figured out our approach to the show, solicited regular feedback, and general got a handle on the whole thing. By the final episode, <a href="https://winningslowly.org/0.14/">0.14: Deep In Their Bones</a>, we had found our basic formula and settled into a nice rhythm, which we were then able to carry into Season 1.
