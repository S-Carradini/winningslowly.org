        <p>There are plenty of podcasts that will tell you how Apple’s latest product will affect the tech landscape <em>tomorrow</em>, but there aren’t that many concerned with the potential impact of that tech a decade from now. In a culture obsessed with <em>now</em>, how can we make choices with a view for tomorrow, next year, and beyond?</p>
        <p>Episodes (usually) come out every other Tuesday at 7 am Eastern time. If unforeseen scheduling issues arise, we will add a note below accordingly. Episodes are normally 25–30 minutes long.</p>

            <h4 id="season-4"><a href="/season-4.html">Season 4</a></h4>
            <p>In our spring 2016 season, we took a long look at globalization: the good, the bad, the ugly. (This was also the first time we planned a season start to finish before we kicked it off, and it shows.)</p>
            <p>We talked about everything from international business (<a href='//www.winningslowly.org/4.08/'>4.08: A Ghost in Singapore</a>) to <cite>Star Wars</cite> (<a href='//www.winningslowly.org/4.03'>4.03: The Podcast Awakens</a> and <a href='//www.winningslowly.org/4.04'>4.04: But Was It a Good Movie?</a>) and from social media in a populist era (<a href='//www.winningslowly.org/4.10'>4.10: The Ancient Wisdom of Usenet</a>) to the challenges of global benevolence (<a href='//www.winningslowly.org/4.02/'>4.01: Unambiguously Meh</a>, <a href='//www.winningslowly.org/4.02/'>4.02: Helpiness</a>, and <a href='//www.winningslowly.org/4.02/'>4.09: We’re Idealist Realists</a>)</p>
            <p>Along the way, we developed an important distinction between the <em>reasonable</em> and the <em>justifiable</em>: a way to help us bridge the gap with people we disagree with, while still disagreeing with them—sometimes fervently.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4 id="season-3"><a href="/season-3.html">Season 3</a></h4>
            <p>Season 3 was our first attempt at doing a more topical season, with an emphasis on the relationship between advertising, busines interests, and capitalism and human flourishing.</p>
            <p>We kicked off the season with <a href="//www.winningslowly.org/3.01/">3.01: The Ad-Driven Web, Part I</a> and <a href="//www.winningslowly.org/3.02/">3.02: The Ad-Driven Web, Part II</a> on July 21 and 28, 2015, respectively, and concluded with some lightning round-style episodes in <a href="//www.winningslowly.org/3.14/">3.14: Smorgasbord, Part I</a> and <a href="//www.winningslowly.org/3.15/">3.15: Smorgasbord, Part II</a> on October 27 and November 3, 2015, respectively. The season also included our first interview: <a href='//www.winningslowly.org/3.09/'>3.09: Many Beautiful Things</a>, with Ryan O’Neal of Sleeping at Last.</p>

            <h4 id="season-2"><a href="/season-2.html">Season 2</a></h4>
            <p>Season 2 began with <a href="//www.winningslowly.org/2.01/">2.01: Take My Money Please!</a> on January 27, 2015 and concluded with <a href="//www.winningslowly.org/2.15/">2.15: Metapodcasting</a> on May 12, 2015.</p>
            <p>Think of this as our “tightening things up now that we know what we’re doing” season and you won’t be far wrong.

        <section>
            <h4 id="season-1"><a href="/season-1.html">Season 1</a></h4>
            <p>Our first “official” season—the one that was <em>not</em> a “beta”—started on July 15, 2014, with <a href="//www.winningslowly.org/1.01/">1.01: Massive Emotional Contagion</a>, and wrapped up with the release of <a href="//www.winningslowly.org/1.18/">1.18: Keep On Keepin’ On</a> on November 18, 2014.</p>
            <p>The main hiccup in Season 1? Stephen’s audio. It varies like crazy week to week, for reasons that eluded us. We blame grumpy, grumpy monkeys.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4 id="season-0"><a href="/season-0.html">Season 0</a></h4>
            <p>Our first season: “This is a beta; bear with us!”—in which we spent a few months just figuring out what we were doing, ran from January 28, 2014 until May 20, 2014. Seriously: we had <em>no idea</em> what we were doing; we just knew we had a good idea for a show and wanted to figure out how to make it work. There is good content here, but we have kept this around mostly for historical interest—it’s <em>rough</em>.</p>
            <p>Episodes ranged in length from over 45 minutes to under 20 minutes as we figured out our approach to the show, solicited regular feedback, and general got a handle on the whole thing. By the final episode, <a href="//www.winningslowly.org/0.14/">0.14: Deep In Their Bones</a>, we had found our basic formula and settled into a nice rhythm, which we were then able to carry into Season 1.</p>
