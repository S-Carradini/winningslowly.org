### Show Notes

We discuss the problems that face major nation-states trying to respond to the massive refugee crisis in Europe. We also look at the complex relationship between nations on topics like this in a "global world" (*nice*, Chris) and suggest that Americans both invest actively in making things better and chill out a bit insofar as we don't live in Europe.
