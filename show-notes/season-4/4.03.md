### Show Notes

We say a few serious things about the nature of global fandom, the relationship
between art and brand awareness in large media properties, and the future of as
large a property as _Star Wars_.

But let's be honest: mostly, we geek out.

### Music

  - "Main Title" from _Star Wars_, by John Williams. Fair use. And *amazing*.
  - ["Winning Slowly Theme"](//soundcloud.com/chriskrycho/winning-slowly)
    by Chris Krycho, who started composing in no small part because of the "Twin
    Suns" cue from _A New Hope_, which rocked his world when he was just a
    little kid, and nothing was ever the same.
