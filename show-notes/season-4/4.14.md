### Show Notes

We use the Panama Papers as a jumping-off point to sum up the season and talk about:

  - the alleged flatness of the world
  - the possibilities of both globalization and localization
  - the twin dangers of imperialism and parochialism
  - the ways that growing income inequality intersect with globalization
  - the things different cultures can learn from each other
  - the distinction between "reasonable" and "justifiable" responses
  - the importance of humility, whether in art or in charitable action
  - the value of choosing *not* to do something at times

In other words: how can you be a *good actor* in a global space?

As an aside, on the rough size of a Word file (referenced with regard to the size of the Panama Papers data release): a 20-page paper from Chris' seminary degree is about 52 kilobytes. 2 gigabytes would be 20,000 such papers.
