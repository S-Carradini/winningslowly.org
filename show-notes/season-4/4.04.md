### Show Notes

Following up on our [previous conversation][4.03] about _The Force Awakens_,
this week we look at what makes art *good*, especially in the context of film.
Was the latest _Star Wars_ actually a good movie?

### Music

  - "Rey's Theme" from _Star Wars: The Force Awakens_, by John Williams. Fair
    use. Utterly lovely.
  - ["Winning Slowly Theme"](//soundcloud.com/chriskrycho/winning-slowly) by
    Chris Krycho, who still thinks that when he grows up he'd like to be a
    composer like John Williams.
