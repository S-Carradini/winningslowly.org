### Show Notes

In this second of two episodes recorded live at NC State (with a different class of students), we tackle the European Union's approach to internet legislation---including everything from copyright law to dealing with monopolies---as a way to look at how differently things work around the world. What might we learn from other countries here in the U.S.? What might they learn from us?
