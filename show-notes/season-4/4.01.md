### Show Notes

We open our fourth season with a discussion of Facebook's [Internet.org]
platform, open access vs. power plays by large companies, and the ethical
questions at the intersection of business and philanthropy. Chris and Stephen
disagree about how to read Facebook's move, and set the stage for a season-long
discussion of globalization and its ramifications for technology, religion,
ethics, and art.

[Internet.org]: https://info.internet.org/en/

Just some light discussion to start things off, in other words.
