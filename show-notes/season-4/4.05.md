### Show Notes

We dive back into the deep end with a discussion of the necessity and challenge
of compromise in the political realm. How do we work steadily but slowly toward
the things we value? How do decide what we can compromise on and what we can't?
Can we "trade favors" in a good way? What about people working at totally cross
purposes on a given issue?

#### Corrigenda

The Myanmar military party no longer has a majority, but retains a substantial
fraction of the parliamentary seats.
