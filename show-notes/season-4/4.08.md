### Show Notes

We invite [Ghost] cofounder John O'Nolan on the show to talk about Ghost's reincorporation in Singapore, what that means for them as a non-profit, and how we should think about these kinds of moves. We talk about everything from the specific details of Ghost's move to the ethics of business tourism, and John basically hammers on themes we've been talking about all season. It's *fantastic*.
