### Show Notes

We look at how Christianity is changing as it shifts from being heavily Western to being far more global (as it was in its birth). What new things might we see and learn as other eyes come to the same text? What do the various cultures of the world have to offer each other as we practice the same, ancient faith?


### Links

- Reading we've found helpful on today's topic:

    + [_Misreading the Bible Through Western Eyes: Removing Cultural Blinders to Better Understand the Bible_][misreading] (E. Randolph Richards and Brandon J. O'Brien)
    + [_Theology in the Context of World Christianity: How the Global Church Is Influencing the Way We Think about and Discuss Theology_​][world] (Timothy Tennent)
    + [_The Next Evangelicalism: Releasing the Church from Western Cultural Captivity_][next] (Soong-Chan Rah)

    (Note that we don't endorse everything in these books, as we don't with *most* things we link---but that particularly bears repeating when looking at theology.)
