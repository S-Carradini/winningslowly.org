### Show Notes

We pick up from our discussion of Facebook and Internet.org last week to look
at the broader questions we raised then: how do you help people *well*? It's
not enough to have good intentions---so how do you pick good charities to give
to? How do you choose where to dedicate your own time and money? How should we
think about foreign aid, and foreign intervention, and foreign policy in
general?
