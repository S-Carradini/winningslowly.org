### Show Notes

We look at internet policy and regulations as a view into the broader question of the relationship between government regulations and markets. Are all regulations harmful to the free market? Is a free market always the best? How do ideas like net neutrality and local loop unbundling play into it?

#### Correction

Chris said, wrongly, that the North Carolina state government prevented Charlotte from building its own municipal fiber. What actually happened was the state passed a law preventing cities (like Wilson, North Carolina, which with the FCC sued the state but ultimately lost in a federal appeals court) from building out infrastructure to *other* communities (including rural areas outside the incorporated area of the city). The laws claimed to be in defense of competition; but there is notably no rush to build higher-speed internet to those rural areas.

#### The Winning Slowly Internet Platform

What do *we* think is necessary for a well-functioning internet?

1. **Consistency and Reliability**: or, you should be able to get sufficient speeds to learn or do your job on a normal basis.
2. **A Free/Functioning Market for Content**: or, a level playing field for all the bits.
3. **A Competitive Market for Internet Service**: or, enabling (1) and (2) by making internet service providers earn customers.
