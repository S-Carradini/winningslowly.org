### Show Notes

It's one thing to be pro-vaccination. It's another to mandate vaccinations for everyone on the same schedule without any exceptions.

It's one thing to be an anti-vaxxer. It's something else entirely to have reservations about the particular schedule a government mandates.

How do we defend great common goods when they pose small, but real, individual risks?

*Carefully.*
