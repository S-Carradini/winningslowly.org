### Show Notes

In the wake of the surprising outcome of the 2016 American presidential election, we talk about how we do politics going forward. In particular, we look at how empathy and treating each other (no matter how sharp our differences) as people made in the image of God *must* inform our politics, even as we acknowledge that no amount of empathy will overcome all disagreements.
