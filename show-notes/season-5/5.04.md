### Show Notes

We talk about orchestras, ask whether financial viability is a guide to the health or importance of particular institutions (hint: [Betteridge's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines)), and look at how orchestras and other such institutions can be real markers of cultural health even for the people they don't directly affect.

Flanagan:

    > The permanent orchestra season has, as usual, been financially a bad one all over the country. With the end of April... come the bills for those who pay the piper.... There is always a deficit, which public-spirited guarantors are called upon to pay year after year. A permanent orchestra, it seems pretty welle stablished by American experience, is not at present a paying institution, and is not likely immediately to become so.... [Neverthless,] the prevailing note of the guarantors of the America Orchestras is one of hopefulness. Things are coming on; the public is being educated; it will support the orchestras in larger and larger numbers till they are finally... self-supporting.
