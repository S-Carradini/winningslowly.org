### Show Notes

We talk about out explicitly Christian ethics - including our ethics of technology. How do we reason about technologies as individuals and communities? What *is* human flourishing?

Articles on the self-driving car crash:

- ["Can You Sue a Robot?", Ian Bogost/_The Atlantic_](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/can-you-sue-a-robocar/556007/) - a fairly thoughtful argument… which nonetheless ends up with some sweeping judgments of just the sort that we're not sure are warranted in *this* specific case.

- L. M. Sacasas with some important [reservations about Heidegger](https://thefrailestthing.com/2018/03/17/dna-kits-alchemy-and-the-essence-of-technology/) - reservations we share about a man who, whatever his influence, seems to have been a Nazi sympathizer.

- [Mal’s speech in _Serenity_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VR3Av9qfZc):

    > A year from now, ten, they'll swing back to the belief that they can make people... better. And I do not hold to that.
