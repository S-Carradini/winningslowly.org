    Google Glass failed miserably. Why? Because people sometimes *do* reject technologies. But why? Mostly, snap judgments that were right on target.

### Show Notes

Google Glass failed miserably. Why? Because people sometimes *do* reject technologies. But *why*? People's snap judgments are far from infallible, of course, but in this case they seem to have been correct. How can we train our snap judgments to be correct more often? And how can we interrogate and sharpen our own judgments?

Google Glass background and commentary:

- [Google X and the Science of Radical Creativity: How the secretive Silicon Valley lab is trying to resurrect the lost art of invention](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/11/x-google-moonshot-factory/540648/) (_The Atlantic_) – with this important note that Stephen mentioned during the show:

    > First, they said, Glass flopped not because it was a bad consumer product but because it wasn’t a consumer product at all. The engineering team at X had wanted to send Glass prototypes to a few thousand tech nerds to get feedback. But as buzz about Glass grew, Google, led by its gung-ho co-founder Sergey Brin, pushed for a larger publicity tour—including a ted Talk and a fashion show with Diane von Furstenberg. Photographers captured Glass on the faces of some of the world’s biggest celebrities, including Beyoncé and Prince Charles, and Google seemed to embrace the publicity. At least implicitly, Google promised a product. It mailed a prototype. (Four years later, Glass has reemerged as a tool for factory workers, the same group that showed the most enthusiasm for the initial design.)
