Summary: >
    Blockchain as a lens into one motivation for regulation: technologies that are (at least apparently) virtuous for individuals but vicious for societies and possibly the world as a whole.

### Show Notes

Blockchain and the associated currencies and techniques derived from it have been in the news a lot for the last few years. And it's an incredibly interesting technology, which basically only has *benefits* for individual users – but has some profoundly distortive effects at scale, on everything from economics to energy consumption. So what do we do about it?

      > Every block introduces 50 new coins in the system. This quantity (50) halves every 210,000 blocks. So, getting the limit of coins it is possible to generate is quite easy: it's the sum of a geometric series.

      The total number of bitcoins that *can* ever be created is 21,000,000.

We also discussed the importance of regulation in some detail in a couple episodes in season 5:

- [5.09: Regulate All the Things](https://winningslowly.org/5.09/) - on regulations and the open internet
- [5.11: Fences, Neighbors, Etc.](https://winningslowly.org/5.11/) – on vaccinations and the application of force
