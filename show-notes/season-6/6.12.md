### Show Notes

Back in September, we recorded this episode live, both of us in person, at [Pikes Peak Brewing Company][ppbc] in Monument, Colorado—as Stephen was out visiting Chris and just hanging out for a weekend. We talk a bit about the history of the beer industry in the 20th and 21st century, with an eye to the way that government intervention can variously make things much worse *or* much better, when it's tailored just right.

…and then we failed to publish it for almost exactly 2 months, because [Chris ended up with a horrible case of burnout][burnout].
