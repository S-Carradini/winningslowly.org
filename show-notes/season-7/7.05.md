## Show Notes

![Stephen gesticulating wildly!](./stephen-gesticulating-7.05.jpg)

### Links

- [The New Sewer Socialists](https://logicmag.io/03-the-new-sewer-socialists/), Evan Malmgren, <cite>Logic</cite>

- [An alternate ending to the tragedy of the commons](https://nadiaeghbal.com/tragedy-of-the-commons), Nadia Eghbal, on Elinor Ostrom’s [<cite>Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action</cite>](https://www.alibris.com/Governing-the-Commons-The-Evolution-of-Institutions-for-Collective-Action-Elinor-Ostrom/book/2669676?matches=45)

    > Ostrom noticed there are many situations where common resources are allocated efficiently, without intervention from the market or state. She explores, through a series of case studies, why this occurred, and under what conditions we could recreate these situations.
