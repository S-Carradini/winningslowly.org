## Show Notes

We chat with [Ari Wallach] of [Longpath] about his vision for the future and the importance of trans-generational ethics. (There's obviously a lot we both find valuable and disagree with here… keep your ears open for reflection on some of those differences in the future!)

### Corrigenda

Buckminster Fuller [didn't invent the trimtab](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anton-Flettner)—but he did invent the metaphor of the social aspects of trimtab!
