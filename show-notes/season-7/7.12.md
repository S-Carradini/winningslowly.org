### Show notes

Which would make for healthy localist cities in 80 years: sustainable long-distance transportation, or really great virtual reality? Chris says sustainable long-distance transporation. Stephen says <abbr title="virtual reality">VR</abbr>. *Fight!*

(In which the phrase “I don’t think that’s true!" appears more than any other episode of the show… ever.)
