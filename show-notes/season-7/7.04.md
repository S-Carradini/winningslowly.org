Rejecting solutionism, the problems of the humane, and wise change.

## Show Notes

We dig into the challenge of taking a non-solutionist approach and rejecting a technocratic view of the world… while not rejecting “interventions” and making real progress along the way.

### Corrections

Stephen accidentally referred to Chris’ reference in [his newsletter][atss] to C. S. Lewis’ foreword to St. Athanasius’ <cite>On the Incarnation</cite> as “On the Annunciation”—the annunciation is a related but distinct bit of Christian doctrine, when the Incarnation was <i>announced</i> (‘annunciated’) to Mary, the mother of Jesus.

Chris thought we talked about thinking-together-about-cell-phones in Season 4; it was [all the way back in Season 3][3.10].
