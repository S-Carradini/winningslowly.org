### Show Notes

#### Errata

Chris, because he was slightly sick, forgot that although we were *recording* in February, the episode was *coming out* in March. This threw off everything we said about dates for the rest of the episode. Whoops!

(The book schedule is adjusted accordingly [below](#upcoming-books).)
