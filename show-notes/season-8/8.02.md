### Show Notes

We really only did one thing in this episode: talked about Plato’s [<cite>Phaedrus</cite>][Phaedrus]! What did Plato say? How did he say it? What does it mean? There are, though, [*lots* of interpretations](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C3&q=plato+phaedrus+&btnG=).
