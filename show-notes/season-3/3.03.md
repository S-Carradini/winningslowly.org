Ashley Madison got hacked and blackmailed by people who hate Ashley Madison's
adultery-as-a-business-model, erm, business model. We *also* hate adultery, but
we're not so sure that hacking and blackmail is the right solution to this
particular problem.

### Music

  - ["There's No Love"], by [We Are Magnetic]. Used by permission.
  - ["Winning Slowly Theme"](//soundcloud.com/chriskrycho/winning-slowly)
    by Chris Krycho. He's been playing with electronica lately, so maybe you'll
    get an electronica version eventually---but maybe not, because that would be
    a little strange.
