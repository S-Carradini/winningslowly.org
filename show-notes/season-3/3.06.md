We geek, we gush, and we even manage to say a few serious things about the
future of humanity while talking about New Horizons, Rosetta, science fiction,
nation-state rivalries, and how we would *love* to go visit other places in the
solar system (or galaxy).

**Errata:** Chris said New Frontiers was an ESA probe; it was in fact a NASA
probe. He was thinking of [Rosetta], an [ESA] project to land on a comet---which
they did, after [the greatest gravity boost sequence in history][gravity]:

**Note:** yep, those are children fussing in the background at one point in the
show. Chris has a 3-year-old daughter and a 1-year-old daughter, and the
1-year-old happened to lose her mind mid-recording. This is one of the many
times a [better microphone] might be nice!

["The guys behind MegaBots say their giant fighting robot will pioneer an
entirely new, worldwide sport"][robots] -- and while we think that claim might
be a bit over the top, it's still hilarious and kind of great.
