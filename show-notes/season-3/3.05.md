    responsibility.

Blogging is not what it was in 2008. It has changed in some ways for the better,
in some ways for the worse, and in a few ways that it's hard to tell. Picking up
from an Iranian blogger, Hossein Derakhshan, who was jailed for his political
views in 2008, we take a look at hyperlinking, the stream, and personal agency.
How can we keep the good of the blog world of 2008 *and* the good of the stream?

#### Before You Go
[TUCOWS], parent company of [Hover] and [Ting] nailed its response to an
intrusion on their servers. Note that Chris uses both Hover and Ting, and in
fact winningslowly.org is registered at Hover---but we're not getting anything
from them (rather the opposite!)

See also our tweets back and forth with them [here][hovertweets]---turns out a
kind word can be really appreciated.
