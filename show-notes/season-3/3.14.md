We start wrapping up Season 3, tackling five topics that one or the other of us
wanted to talk about but couldn't get the other one all that excited about, or
which we didn't feel like we had enough to say yet:

  - venture capitalism (both of us)
  - online classes (Stephen)
  - the ethics of algorithms (Chris)
  - tracking people at work (Stephen)
  - transparency in business (Chris)
