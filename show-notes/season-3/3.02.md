In which we continue our conversation from [3.01](/3.01/), turning our attention from
the system issues which led to the modern state of the web to what we ought to
do about it---as consumers of content, as producers of content, and even as
advertisers.

  - [Quartz:] "Over one-fifth of people use ad-blocking software---and it's
    beginning to hurt"

  - Ad blocking:
      + [AdBlock Plus](https://adblockplus.org)---associated with some
        not-so-savory practices, including letting advertisers buy their way
        onto a white list.

      + μBlock: aiming to be super light-weight, and no shenanigans about
        letting advertisers buy exceptions. Two variants:

          * [μBlock](https://www.ublock.org)
          * [μBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)---the blocker
            Chris uses.

        The reasons for the split are political, personal, and quirky. Welcome
        to open-source software!

  - [Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us)

  - Tracking-blockers:
      + [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/en/)---alleged to have some
        similar issues to Adblock with their relationship to trackers.
      + [Disconnect.me](https://disconnect.me)---the ad tracking blocker Chris
        users. Identifies what trackers and third-party cookies are blocked on
        any given page, and allows you to enable or disable them as you like.

  - Previously on the show:
      + On Circa:
          * [2.01: Take My Money Now!](/2.01)
          * [2.15: Metapodcasting](/2.15/)
      + [0.03: Echo Chamber](/0.03/)---we talked about "losing parts of the
        internet" via link rot, which is a big part of why we're supporting
        the Internet Archive.
