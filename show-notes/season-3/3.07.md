    Amazon’s workplace culture as a view into corporate ethics and
    responsibility

In which we quite aggressively tackle Amazon's corporate treatment of its
workers, and launch into a discussion of corporate ethics and responsibility. We
also note that though we critique Amazon's practices, we recognize that it has
good effects in the world, some of them significant. The question is: at what
point to the externalities associated with those benefits make dealing with any
given company morally unjustifiable?

  - The original piece which sparked this discussion: ["Inside Amazon: Wrestling
    Big Ideas in a Bruising Workplace"][nyt]
  - ["Why the New York Times’s Amazon story is so controversial, explained"][vox]
    (Vox) -- with a scathing and accurate comment on blue-collar workers as the real
    problem for Amazon:

    > The real workplace scandal at Amazon --- and in the economy writ large ---
    > isn't the treatment of white-collar workers with plenty of options. It's
    > the treatment of blue-collar workers with none.
    >
    > Most of Amazon's workers, after all, aren't highly paid engineers or
    > marketers sitting in a Seattle office. They're contract warehouse workers
    > rushing frantically to meet their packing quotas.

shares nosedive on China economic woes"][bbc-china]. Notably, as we predicted it
might, things substantially stabilized throughout the week elsewhere in the
world.
