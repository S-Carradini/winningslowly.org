We talk about how we present ourselves on social media: what happens as we
present different aspects of ourselves over time? How do we manage those
changes? How does the flattening out effect of social media and searchability
intersect (or conflict) with the way we think about our social circles in "real"
(that is, embodied, non-virtual) life?
