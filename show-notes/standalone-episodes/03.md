### Show Notes

It's been four and a half years and 100 episodes of Winning Slowly! We pause to take a bit to reflect on what we've done, what we're about, and where we hope to go from here. We also reflect on some of our craziest titles along the way. ("Buying Me Off With Warm Fuzzies"? "Juice Up the Weird Edges of the Ecosystem"? These got wild at times.)
