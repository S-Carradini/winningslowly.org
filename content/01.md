### Show notes

In which we talk about how context shapes (or *should* shape) our decisions
regarding technology, with three big topics:

- Christian author and former pastor [John Piper][jp] and [Pope Francis][pope]
  on Twitter

- Google acquiring Nest and the ensuing internet freakout

- Intentionally unprofitable bands and the changing shape of music industry, as
  highlighted by miniature label [Controlled Burn Records][cbr] and band
  [Nonagon][nonagon]
