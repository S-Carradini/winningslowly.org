    > We need to question what it means for people to have relationships with devices and services coming out of well-funded, fledging startups — especially when those startups reach beyond the digital into the physical world. Companies like Nest raise the bar for what’s needed in trustful relationships. It’s one thing for the economics of startup exits to ignore users in a digital space. But in a physical space, those “users” are people who are harder to ignore, because their relationships with the service is in part physical. Physical trust, let alone loyalty, can’t be transferred on someone else’s whim.
