- ["The Year the Stream Crested", _The Atlantic_](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/2013-the-year-the-stream-crested/282202/)

    > *It is too damn hard to keep up. And most of what's out there is crap.*

    > When the half-life of a post is half a day or less, how much time can
    > media makers put into something? When the time a reader spends on a story
    > is (on the high end) two minutes, how much time *should* media makers put
    > into something?

    > The necessity of nowness plus the professionalization of content
    > production for the stream means that there are thousands and thousands of
    > people churning out more crap than can possibly be imagined. And
    > individual consumers of information have been tuned by social-media
    > feedback mechanisms (Likes!) to do for free what other people do for
    > money. They, too, write viral headlines, post clickbait, and compete for
    > mindshare.

    > ...

    > I think people will want structure and endings again, eventually. Edges
    > and balance are valuable.
    > 
    > The great irony is that we got what we wanted from the stream: a way to
    > read and watch outside the editorial control of editors, old Yahoo-style
    > cataloging, and Google bots. But when the order of the media cosmos was
    > annihilated, freedom did not rush into the vacuum, but an emergent order
    > with its own logic. We discovered that the stream introduced its own kinds
    > of compulsions and controls. Faster! More! Faster! More! Faster! More!
    >
    > And now, who can keep up? There is a melancholy to the infinite scroll.
    >
    > Wouldn't it be better if we just said ... Let's do something else? Let's
    > have the web be a museum or a curio box or an important information filter
    > or an organizing platform.
    >
    > Or maybe let's just let the web be the web again, a network of many times,
    > not just now.
